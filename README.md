   This project is about creating a 2-page website that talks about me.
   The Main page lists short details about me and the Accomplishments page shows some of my accomplishments. 
    
   This project was created as part of a virtual, self-paced learning program with a coding club.
    
   I used HTML 5 and CSS 3 languages to create the website.
   Since this is my very first experience creating a website, I learnt many concepts in the process.
   I learnt about HTML tag elements, navigation bar, uploading images, CSS styling rules using classes and IDs etc.
   
   I used wireframes to come up with the layout of the website.
   Furthermore, the code was written using the Replit IDE.
